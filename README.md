# Rock-Paper-Scissors: Evolved Edition

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors: Evolved Edition! This project reimagines the classic game by introducing advanced mechanics, unique enhancements, and a robust system of player interactions. Dive into an experience where your strategic choices shape the outcome of battles between players and computers, or even between computers themselves!

## Project Overview

Rock-Paper-Scissors: Evolved Edition is a sophisticated iteration of the timeless game, blending traditional gameplay with innovative features. Our version includes:

- **Enhanced Game Mechanics**: Beyond basic rock, paper, and scissors, the game features "Heavy Rock", "Special Paper", and "Master Scissors", each with distinct attributes and evolution paths.
- **Dual Modes**: Play against the computer or pit two AIs against each other in an engaging simulation.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Experience evolving objects with resilience and leveling mechanics that add depth and strategy to each match.

## Features

- **Advanced Object Attributes**: Objects in the game have unique characteristics and can evolve based on their performance and interactions.
- **Resilience and Leveling**: Objects gain resilience and experience points through gameplay, impacting their effectiveness in battles.
- **Detailed Statistics**: Track the performance and statistics of both human and AI players in real-time.
- **Versatile Game Modes**: Choose between user-computer or computer-computer modes to test your strategies against different types of opponents.

## Technology Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for implementing game logic and object interactions.
- **Abstract Classes and Inheritance**: Utilized to define and manage complex object behaviors and attributes.
- **Switch-Case Structures**: Employed for handling game flow and decision-making processes.
- **Randomization Algorithms**: Used for generating random choices and scenarios for the computer player.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Applied to structure the gameâ€™s components and ensure modularity and scalability.

## Gameplay Instructions
